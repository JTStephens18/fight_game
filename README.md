I wanted to create a game where you could mint from a set of NFTs and have attributes that update dynamically for your NFT only. 

I developed and tested this application on the Rinkeby testnet. I utilized React.js, Solidity, hardhat, and ethers.js to help me build it.

I came up with a very creative name and called it Just Some Guys Fighting. Before anything happens, you must connect your wallet:

Once your wallet is connected you can choose between three characters to be your champion. Each character has different health values, attack values, and properties. So choose wisely. Leafy Larry is obviously the best choice, but you do you.

There is a loading animation once you have decided on your character until the minting transaction is completed.

Once your NFT is minted, you get taken to the boss room where you must defeat the menacing Greg!
Click that attack button to beat the old man up. It may take some time, so there is a loading animation here as well. 

You must be careful because, despite his looks, old man Greg can pack a serious punch and will attack you right back.

We see here that our character's health and Greg's health have both gone down. We can take a peek at our NFT on OpenSea and see that our NFT's health metadata has also changed.
